## Project: Facial Key Points
Apply knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoints (eyes, mouth, nose, etc.) detection.

## Project: Image Captioning
Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image, using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset.

## Project: Landmark Detection and Tracking (SLAM)
Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding in a 2-dimensional world. The goal is to combine what we know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.
