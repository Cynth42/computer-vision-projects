    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For the encoder model, I used a pre-trained ResNet(Residual Network) which has been known to achieve great success in image classification. We use batch normalization because according to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167), it \"allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout.\" It is also believed to be the best for this setup, as this value is able to achieve good learning speed while still producing results at the same time. The CNN-RNN architecture has been designed a neural network that is consisting of a vision CNN connected to a langauge generating RNN to enable Neural image caption. So in this architecture the CNN acts as the encoder while the RNN acts as the decoder.  The decoder is an RNN which has an Embedding layer, a LSTM layer and a fully-connected layer. LSTM has been shown to be successful in sequence generation.  The idea was to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain large fixed-dimensional vector representation consists in the output from the Encoder part.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the batch size, I experimented with different batch sizes starting from the default batch size 32 then I moved up to 64 and finally 128.  Therefore I chose 128 because the Loss and Perplexity was better than when the batch size was 32 and 64.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For vocab_threshold, as I assumed there should be many strange rarer words in a caption and result in a larger vocabulary, I decided to go for a smaller threshold of 4 to accomplish that goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "I set The word embedding size to 512 (which is much bigger than the value in the described embeddings of size 200-300 in GloVe and Word2Vec recommended in the videos) because using a relatively bigger-sized vector would increase the possibility to learn something useful. Smaller embeddings such as 256 was also performed.  The number of hidden states for the LSTM module was selected to be 512 as well for a similar reason where the embed_size and the hidden_size should be the same to extract the same features and pass through the same number of feature vector to the Decoder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since training for 5 or 10 epochs has not seemed to improve the quality of the predictions much, I trained the model for 3 number of epochs which give a good prediction with ending loss and perplexity 6.41166. So I stopped training the model at 3 epochs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For save_every, I chose one epoch.  Then my print_every is set to 100 weight to determine window for printing average loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the transform at its provided value because when setting this transform, we keep two things in mind: the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and since we are using a pre-trained model, we must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.  And according to this [Pytorch Doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html), like other pre-trained models, ResNet expects input images normalized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are expected to have width and height of at least 224. The first and second transformations resize and crop the images to 224 x 224:\n",
    "transforms.Resize(256),                          # smaller edge of image resized to 256\n",
    "transforms.RandomCrop(224),                      # get 224x224 crop from random location\n",
    "\n",
    "The images have to be converted from numpy.ndarray (H x W x C) in the range [0, 255] to a torch.FloatTensor of shape (C x H x W) in the range [0.0, 1.0]:\n",
    "transforms.ToTensor(),                           # convert the PIL Image to a tensor\n",
    "Then they are normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. This is achieved using the last transformation step:\n",
    "transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406),      # normalize image for pre-trained model\n",
    "                       (0.229, 0.224, 0.225))\n",
    "The data augmentation step transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip() improves the accuracy of the image classification task as mentioned in this [paper](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/300.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there was no need to change the transform values.  These values are a good choice for my CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes I think is a good choice because according to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf), the \"loss is minimized w.r.t. all the parameters of the LSTM, the top layer of the image embedder CNN and word embeddings.\" I followed this strategy and choose the parameters accordingly. Since we also added a Batch Normalization layer, we will optimize its parameters too. This makes sense for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "The EncoderCNN in this project uses ResNet which has been pre-trained on an image classification task. So we don't have to optimize the parameters of the entire network again for a similar image classification task. \n",
    "\n",
    "We only need to optimize the top layer whose outputs are fed into the DecoderRNN.  The DecoderRNN is not a pre-trained network, so we have to optimize all its parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding size of 512 has been selected as a starting point, and this value stick because it seems quite reasonable in terms of the speed and quality of the predictions generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** According to this [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf), Adam optimizer works best on the MS COCO Dataset. It adjusts learning rate and momentum for each parameter individually, which effectively simulated a band-pass filter that suppresses gradient noise, thereby reducing the need to come up with a learning rate schedule. It is consequently a good go-to choice for an optimizer in the context of this project than SGD optimizer. \n"

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
